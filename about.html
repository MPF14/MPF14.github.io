        <p class="bodytext">Hi! My name is Matilda, and I’m a junior in high school. I started Equitable FYI to help my peers and community become more aware of the social and political justice issues happening around us. My goal is to create a space where information is accessible, conversations are encouraged, and young people feel empowered to make a difference.</p>
