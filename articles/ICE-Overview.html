<h2 class="title">ICE - Overview</h2>
<p class="subtext">By Matilda Fletcher <br><br>
This article is a part of a mini-series documenting ICE</p>
<div class="article">
<p class="bodytext">Across the US, people are plastering anti-ICE signs in their windows,  on their lawns, and at their businesses. ICE is one of the most controversial Federal agencies. 
<br><br>
United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement was founded under the supervision of the United States Department of Homeland Security in March 2003 in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It aimed to prevent terrorism, control illegal trade, and remove undocumented immigrants.
<br><br>
Many criticize ICE for separating families, detaining people in cruel conditions, and conducting mass raids on workplaces. They have been found guilty on many accounts, including violating the Fourth Amendment in several states. Further, the Supreme Court has allowed them to use racial profiling to discriminate against marginalized communities. 
<br><br>
While ICE has been a major focus of Donald Trump’s current presidency, the agency’s actions have real impacts on immigrants and their communities. Many detainees have no criminal records or are long-term residents who are integral to their communities.</p>
