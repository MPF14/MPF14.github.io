    <h2 class="title">Interview with Geoffrey Fletcher</h2>
    <p class="subtext">Transcribed by Matilda Fletcher</p>
    <p class="bio">Geoffrey Fletcher is a director, writer, and producer, best known for his Oscar-winning film, <i>Precious</i>. He is the first African American to win the award for writing.</p>

    <p class="bodytext">
    What have you learned about diversity after being the first black writer to win an Oscar?
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Geoffrey</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    Interestingly, I do not think one learns much from success. I think that failure is one of the greatest teachers. I think that over the course of my lifetime, I have learned a lot about it. Certainly in the aftermath of that accomplishment. I have learned a lot because there were still challenges afterward. We always hear how it is a difficult business and really is for everyone. I think it is harder to represent underrepresented groups, than other groups, but difficult all around. When you hear that Steven Spielberg has problems you know, that it is a very, very difficult industry.

    <p class="bodytext">  
    What are some of the messages of inclusion and exclusion that you tried to include in Precious?
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Geoffrey</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    Well, for the most part, my approach was just to tell an honest, empathetic story. I think there is great political value in that people see Precious and her mother they see the other and I think with distance comes dehumanization. So it was important for me to show people that they have the same hopes dreams and struggles that the rest of us do broadly. I did make a point to have Precious’s mother mention that there were more non-Black people on assistance than there were Black people. It is probably disproportionate, but the challenges faced were also disproportionate which undoubtedly led to that situation.

    <p class="bodytext">  
    What was your first encounter with discrimination?
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Geoffrey</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    Well, my first encounter with discrimination that I recall clearly was being followed in the store as a child. I am sure there is some playground stuff as well, but the store is what I remember more clearly.
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Matilda</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    How did you deal with it and what would you do differently now?
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Geoffrey</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    I think that children are extraordinarily alert and sensitive. Many learn very early on how the world works. Understanding that dynamic was there as well as being raised to be very aware of my surroundings I realized that it was an unfortunate fact of life. It got to the point where when I would hear an announcement on the public address system, sometimes I would wonder if it was code of some sort alerting someone to my presence or requesting that I be monitored.
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Matilda</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    What would you have wanted to have known about discrimination and exclusion when you were younger in high school, and what would you tell other high schoolers about discrimination now?
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Geoffrey</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    I think there are several ways to deal with it. The two main categories are to address it or ignore it but above all, not let it determine anything about you or your self-worth and to realize that that other person is the problem, not you. In some situations, getting bad service at a store or restaurant you might simply ask the person’s name and speak to the management or ownership or other people, or now decide not to go where they are tolerated but to go where they are welcome. It is a meaningful statement because your money means a lot better to support people who welcome you than people who tolerate or actively mistreat you.
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Matilda</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    Where do you see racism most?
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Geoffrey</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    I see racism most in education, housing, and employment. The ever-widening wealth gap in this country is startling. All of these factors play into it.
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Matilda</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    What would you say are some examples that would be easy for young people to recognize if they are not used to seeing racism? How would you suggest they begin to recognize discrimination?
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Geoffrey</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    I think it is often apparent in what kinds of jobs people have oftentimes they will see lower-paying jobs occupied by groups that have traditionally been discriminated against, so it is all around us that is one example. Another example is if one looks up the brass or the board of most major corporations or companies it is very clear there as well.
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Matilda</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    What advice would you give a student on preventing discrimination in their community?
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Geoffrey</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    I think first and foremost one can be a good example for others and inspire others to show empathy and not to sin by silence when they witness it. It can be something very low-key, like asking a simple question or letting somebody know that they are better than that. There are a lot of battles in this world and one certainly has to pick them wisely but one can also be an inspiration to others. I think a lot of problems come from dehumanization that you can tell yourself that other people do not feel pain period still country so they come right
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Matilda</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    These conversations are not super easy to have, so how do you make sure that you are aware of other people's emotions? What are ways you suggest of making them more casual and low-key? 
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Geoffrey</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    One thing is you may not even have to say anything to the person who is misbehaving. You might treat the target of their bad behavior kindly or with understanding and that could send a powerful message. I really do not have all the answers to this and I know that there are people who are far more qualified. After all, I am a screenwriter. But my work is based on empathy. When it is at its best. The late critic Roger Ebert said one of the greatest things about movies I have ever heard, he said that there are empathy machines.
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Matilda</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    What do you want people to think about after seeing Precious?
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Geoffrey</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    I hope Precious humanizes people like Precious and her mother. And I hope that Precious serves as an inspiration to others because she overcame so many great challenges and my hope is that she can inspire others to do the same. 
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Matilda</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    Then what were you working on before the strike?
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Geoffrey</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    I was working on a biopic about the great baseball player Hank Aaron and all of the off-field challenges he faced as he broke Babe Ruth's home run record which is the most hallowed record in American sports. I was also working on a biopic about John Lewis and everything came to a stop with the strike.
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Matilda</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    Why is the strike important and what are your hopes for the outcome?
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Geoffrey</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    As I mentioned before this wealth inequality or the wealth gap, however one wants to put it, is a very real thing, and it is causing a lot of people to suffer. Labor unions have been nearly decimated, and they are one of the last places where the so-called little guy and gal could make a living wage I know that they are very wealthy union members as well but I am talking about the everyday person and unions had a huge role to play in building the middle class of America and a strong middle class is something that distinguished America from many other places in the world and over the last 40 years it seems as if they have been struggling if not decimated.
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Matilda</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    What are some of the biggest changes that you have seen over the past few years that unions have made?
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Geoffrey</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    When you adjust for inflation writers and actors have made less money over the last decade, whereas spending on content and profits in many cases have increased. If you look at inflation generally, it is a grim picture for livelihoods.
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Matilda</p>
    <p class="bodytext"> 
    What have you been doing during the strike?
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Geoffrey</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    I have been hoping that a deal can be made. I have walked the picket lines a number of times. I have kept myself busy working on passion projects that I did not have time to work on before, and that is it for the most part. Just continuing to study cinema and experiment with film literacy.
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Matilda</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    Do you have anything else that you would want to tell high schoolers, any closing thoughts? 
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Geoffrey</p>
    <p class="bodytext">  
    I would say that whatever your dream is, do work on it every single day, and it will greatly increase the chance of you realizing your dream. If that becomes a part of your life you will have all sorts of breakthroughs and discoveries and you will get to a place where you will feel strange if you do not devote part of your day or if you do not devote part part of your day to your dream. Ideally, it gets to a place where it does not feel like work and where you look forward to learning and working and learning about working on your craft. Today students have more access to more information than ever and that can also be a challenge, but I heard that the Beatles would go all the way across town if they heard that someone could teach them a new chord. That kind of drive and healthy obsession serves one very well. I think some dreams require one to be all in. If I was not doing what I am doing, I was all in and what I am doing I would not be doing it and teaching, and beyond that, I do not know what I would do. If you ask a lot of people in my industry what they would be doing if they were not in this industry and they do not know, but ultimately be driven by desire or fear and passion. Then you will find you have endless energy and the challenges that come with any industry will be easier to bear because the part of it that you love the most will be so fulfilling.
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Matilda</p>
    <p class="bodytext">
    What is your definition of including someone?
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">Geoffrey</p>
    <p class="bodytext">
    Recognizing the inherent value that we all have, and understanding you can learn something from everyone. I think a lot of this comes down to very simple things, and the golden rule is one of them. It is basically asking yourself, how would you feel if someone mistreated you or excluded you? Now there is something else you asked me about diversity, one of your questions in the industry. You know, there is progress with that. But you know, there is certainly a way to go. I think George Floyd had everything to do with that. And it seems as if, now, it is odd to see a production without a degree of diversity. But in terms of representation and the ability to green-light projects, there is still a way to go.
